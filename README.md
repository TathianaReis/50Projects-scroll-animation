# 50Projects-landing-page
Part of 50 Projects 50 days challenge

Scroll animation, when the user start scrolling and parts of the site, sections of the website start to come in.
When scrolling down the content blocks will come in from the left, and from the right alternating. 
This was done using CSS transitions for the content blocks to come in smoothly.
Used JavaScript to tell where the trigger point is for the next box to come in, and to add a specific class to show it.

When the user I go back up, it'll remove the class when it hits the trigger point and it'll all slide back out.
